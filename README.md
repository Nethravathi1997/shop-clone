  # Myntra

Myntra is a major Indian e-commerce comopany headquartered in Bangalore. The company was founded in 2007 to sell personalized gift items, but now their business model is mainly focused on fashion sector. In May 2014, Myntra was aquired by another Indian e-commerce giant - Flipkart.  

## Project Overview :-

This is a complete full-stack project of developing clone of e-commerce website Myntra.com <br>
This being a backend-focused project, we've not used HTML for creating any markups. Instead every single page in this project is created using a javascript template engine - EJS. EJS enables you to generate full-blown HTML pages with stunning frontend with dynamic data & it can also share templated pieces with other web pages.<br>
Here, we've added all the fuctionalities of the website in our project for a lifelike user experience. Users can browse the products, filter them according to their needs, add them to the cart, check out of the cart and make payments at the end. This replication of whole user experince makes it difficult to differentiate between the original website and our clone version of it. <br>
